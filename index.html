Her professional interests span orthopedics, ergonomics, postural pain, gait analysis, running assessments (including fall risk and vestibular issues), treatment for generalized weakness, neurological conditions, pre and postoperative care, sports injury rehabilitation, and preventive measures to ensure her patients' long-term well-being.</p>

                <p>Kelsie is presently engaged in advanced medical training in Fascial Counterstrain through the <a href="https://www.jicounterstrain.com/">Jones Institute</a>, guided by the expertise of Brian Tuckey.
